# Wazuh_Deployment
Deployment of WAZUH on home network
This environment is up and running. However I wanted to detail some of the obstacles that people could encounter when deploying this incredible powerful tool for their home network. I also have a plan to rebuild this in a server style environment to one utilize some older computers that I have on Windows 10 that have the 7th generation i5 chipset and thus are not compatible to upgrade to Windows 11.
