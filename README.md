### Deployment of WAZUH on home network

This environment is up and running. However I wanted to detail some of the obstacles that people could encounter when deploying this incredibly powerful tool for their home network. 

I also have a plan to rebuild this in a server style environment to; 
- 1) Utilize some older computers that I have on Windows 10 that have the 7th generation i5 chipset and thus are not compatible to upgrade to Windows 11.
- 2) spread the processing burden over mulitple machines instead of just one.
