# Download a Linux Distribution! 
- Ubuntu Desktop is generally a good option. I used Ubuntu 24.04.3 and downloaded it from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- I also downloaded Rufus 4.9.2256 to create the Linux Bootable USB drive. [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/#google_vignette) 
## Ubuntu ISO file
- You can download the ubuntu iso image file onto the computer you will be replacing Windows with. You will use rufus to create a bootable USB drive with the Ubuntu iso image
Once the ubuntu ISO file has been downloaded 'mine was named ubuntu-24.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso' you will need to create the bootable USB drive with rufus.
If you dont have rufus alreadyb installed you can download it [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/#google_vignette)  BE CAUTIOUS, the top "DOWNLOAD" link is generally an ad. Please scroll down until you see file names for different versions of rufus.

Click on the name you want to download. You are likely looking for x64 Standard download and may be a good idea to stay away from beta versions, let others work the possible bugs out on those first.
